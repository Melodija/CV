## Ruta Baltiejute

After helping my family for a while in their financial advising business, our IT guy left for Cyprus. Thinking everything would be fine, we continued as normal. A few weeks later: the server died, the receptionist's computer literally exploded, nobody has access to anything anymore. That week was one of the best in the office. I had to try and fix everything that had broken and learnt so much during it.

This reminded me of how I had wanted to do computer science at university. This led me to search for how I could get into this industry in the not so traditional way when I came across Makers Academy, a 12 week intensive bootcamp teaching you how to code.

From this experience, I was able to discover that it's possible to learn anything no matter what your background is and so I would love to continue to further my knowledge.

## Skills

#### Communication

I have spent the last 12 weeks coding instensively and pairing people all day, everyday. During this, I've been able to explain complex ideas to others as well as help them with debugging. I was able to improve on my general presentation and public speaking skills during my TEFL course. I was taught how to plan and deliver lessons in English to people who had no idea what I was saying. I was able to make it fun and get my point across which also gave me more confidence in these areas. During my time at Coteford Junior School, I was able to aid the teacher in leading the class as well as being able to explain to the children various concepts taught during the lesson. 

#### Leadership

When teaching, I've had to make sure that it was fun and interesting to not lose the interest of my audience. Something I found particularly effective when leading children was that they are always more interested when you speak to them as an equal. Children aren't stupid and I believe that it's important to make them feel like they are important and grown up. 

#### Accuracy

Working as a mortgage adviser's assistant, accuracy was always of high importance. Clients expect their application to be processed as quickly as possible yet I ensured that all their documents were correct and accurate. If incorrect details are submitted to the bank, this can severly delay the process or can completely ruin the applicant's chance of receiving a mortgage offer. 

#### Can ride a bike

Just about. Still a bit wobbly.

## Interests

- Playing piano - in particular video game music (definitely doesn't get enough credit for it)
- Also, hardcore rocking out to piano music as if I'm listening to something else.
- DIY - just generally seeing what I'm able to make myself whether it's beauty products, things around the home or clothing. It poses an interesting challenge.
- Skiing - 10 years worth of snow and ice.
